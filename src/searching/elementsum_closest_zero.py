Two elements whose sum is closest to zero

Question: An Array of integers is given, both +ve and -ve. You need to find the two elements such
that their sum is closest to zero.

For the below array, program should print -80 and 85.

Algorithm:
1) Sort all the elements of the input array.
2) Use two index variables l and r to traverse from left and right ends respectively. Initialize l
   as 0 and r as n-1.
3) sum = a[l] + a[r]
4) If sum is -ve, then l++
5) If sum is +ve, then râ€“
6) Keep track of abs min sum.
7) Repeat steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 while l < r Implementation  """
