Number of Triangles in an Undirected Graph
Given an Undirected simple graph, We need to find how many triangles it can have.

For example below graph have 2 triangles in it.

    0 --- 1 --- 3
     \    |    /
       \  |  /
          2

    0 --- 1     1 --- 2
      \   |     |   /
        \ |     |  /
          2     3

Explanation:

Let A[][] be adjacency matrix representation of graph. If we calculate A3, then the number of
triangle in Undirected Graph is equal to trace(A3) / 6. Where trace(A) is the sum of the elements
on the main diagonal of matrix A.

Trace of a graph represented as adjacency matrix A[V][V] is,
trace(A[V][V]) = A[0][0] + A[1][1] + .... + A[V-1][V-1]

Count of triangles = trace(A3) / 6

How does this work?

If we compute An for an adjacency matrix representation of graph, then a value An[i][j]
represents number of distinct walks between vertex i to j in graph. In A3, we get all distinct
paths of length 3 between every pair of vertices.

A triangle is a cyclic path of length three, i.e. begins and ends at same vertex. So A3[i][i]
represents a triangle beginning and ending with vertex i. Since a triangle has three vertices and
it is counted for every vertex, we need to divide result by 3. Furthermore, since the graph is
undirected, every triangle twice as i-p-q-j and i-q-p-j, so we divide by 2 also. Therefore,
number of triangles is trace(A3) / 6.

Time Complexity: The time complexity of above algorithm is O(V3) where V is number of vertices in
the graph, we can improve the performance to O(V2.8074) using Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication
algorithm."""
