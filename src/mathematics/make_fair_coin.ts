Make a fair coin from a biased coin
You are given a function foo() that represents a biased coin. When foo() is called, it returns 0
with 60% probability, and 1 with 40% probability. Write a new function that returns 0 and 1 with
50% probability each. Your function should use only foo(), no other library method.

Solution:
We know foo() returns 0 with 60% probability. How can we ensure that 0 and 1 are returned with 50%
probability?
The solution is similar to this post. If we can somehow get two cases with equal probability,
then we are done. We call foo() two times. Both calls will return 0 with 60% probability. So the
two pairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) will be generated with equal probability from two calls of foo().
Let us see how.

(0, 1): The probability to get 0 followed by 1 from two calls of foo() = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24
(1, 0): The probability to get 1 followed by 0 from two calls of foo() = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24

So the two cases appear with equal probability. The idea is to return consider only the above two
cases, return 0 in one case, return 1 in other case. For other cases [(0, 0) and (1, 1)],
recur until you end up in any of the above two cases.

function myFun(): number {
    function _foo(): number {
        // given method that returns 0 with 60% probability and 1 with 40%
        return Math.random() < 0.6 ? 0 : 1;
    }
    // returns both 0 and 1 with 50% probability
    const val1 = _foo();
    const val2 = _foo();

    if (val1 === 0 && val2 === 1) {
        return 0;  // Will reach here with 0.24 probability
    }

    if (val1 === 1 && val2 === 0) {
        return 1;  // Will reach here with 0.24 probability
    }

    return myFun();  // will reach here with (1 - 0.24 - 0.24) probability
}

console.log(`${myFun()}`);
