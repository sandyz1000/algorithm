Generate integer from 1 to 7 with equal probability

Given a function foo() that returns integers from 1 to 5 with equal probability, write a function
that returns integers from 1 to 7 with equal probability using foo() only. Minimize the number of
calls to foo() method. Also, use of any other library function is not allowed and no floating
point arithmetic allowed.

------------------------------------------------
Solution:
------------------------------------------------
We know foo() returns integers from 1 to 5. How we can ensure that integers from 1 to 7 occur with
equal probability?
If we somehow generate integers from 1 to a-multiple-of-7 (like 7, 14, 21, â€¦) with equal
probability, we can use modulo division by 7 followed by adding 1 to get the numbers from 1 to 7
with equal probability.

We can generate from 1 to 21 with equal probability using the following expression.

5*foo() + foo() -5

Let us see how above expression can be used.

1. For each value of first foo(), there can be 5 possible combinations for values of second foo().
So, there are total 25 combinations possible.

2. The range of values returned by the above equation is 1 to 25, each integer occurring exactly
once.

3. If the value of the equation comes out to be less than 22, return modulo division by 7 followed
by adding 1. Else, again call the method recursively. The probability of returning each integer
thus becomes 1/7.

        return Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
    }
    
    // Returns 1 to 7 with equal probability
    let i = 5 * foo() + foo() - 5;

    if (i < 22) {
        return (i % 7) + 1;
    }

    return myRand();
