/* """ How does this work? To prove that this solution works perfectly, we must prove that the
probability that any item stream[i] where 0 <= i < n will be in final reservoir[] is k/n. Let us 
divide the proof in two cases as first k items are treated differently. 

https://gregable.com/2007/10/reservoir-sampling.html

Case 1: For last n-k stream items, i.e., for stream[i] where k <= i < n For every such stream 
item stream[i], we pick a random index from 0 to i and if the picked index is one of the first k 
indexes, we replace the element at picked index with stream[i] 

To simplify the proof, let us first consider the last item. The probability that the last item is 
in final reservoir = The probability that one of the first k indexes is picked for last item = 
k/n (the probability of picking one of the k items from a list of size n) 

Let us now consider the second last item. The probability that the second last item is in final 
reservoir[] = [Probability that one of the first k indexes is picked in iteration for stream[
n-2]] X [Probability that the index picked in iteration for stream[n-1] is not same as index 
picked for stream[n-2] ] = [k/(n-1)]*[(n-1)/n] = k/n. 

Similarly, we can consider other items for all stream items from stream[n-1] to stream[k] and 
generalize the proof.

Case 2: For first k stream items, i.e., for stream[i] where 0 <= i < k 
The first k items are initially copied to reservoir[] and may be removed later in iterations for 
stream[k] to stream[n].
The probability that an item from stream[0..k-1] is in final arry = Probability that the item is
not picked when items stream[k], stream[k+1], .... stream[n-1] are
considered = [k/(k+1)] x [(k+1)/(k+2)] x [(k+2)/(k+3)] x â€¦ x [(n-1)/n] = k/n
