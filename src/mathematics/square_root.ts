/* 
Find the square root of the no
Babylonian method for square root

Example:

n = 4 # n itself is used for initial approximation
Initialize x = 4, y = 1
Next Approximation x = (x + y)/2 (= 2.500000), y = n/x  (=1.600000)
Next Approximation x = 2.050000, y = 1.951220
Next Approximation x = 2.000610, y = 1.999390
Next Approximation x = 2.000000, y = 2.000000
Terminate as (x - y) > e now.  

## Method-1
This method can be derived from (but predates) Newtonâ€“Raphson method.
1 Start with an arbitrary positive start value x (the closer to the root, the better).
2 Initialize y = 1.
3. Do following until desired approximation is achieved.
    a) Get the next approximation for root using average of x and y
    b) Set y = n/x


## Method-2:
If we are sure that n is a perfect square, then we can use following method.
The method can go in infinite loop for non-perfect-square numbers.
For example, for 3 the below while loop will never terminate.
Returns the square root of n. Note that the function will not work for numbers
which are not perfect squares

        y = n / x;
    }

// For n is not a perfect square
console.log("\nMethod-1", squareRoot(50));

// For n is a perfect square
console.log("\nMethod-2", squareRoot3(49));
